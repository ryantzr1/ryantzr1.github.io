When it comes to JavaScript package management, npm has been the go-to tool for developers for years. However, as projects grow in scale and complexity, its limitations—disk usage, install speed, and dependency management—start to show. Enter pnpm, a fast, efficient alternative that tackles these issues head-on. In this post, we’ll explore why upgrading from npm to pnpm makes sense, supported by technical details, metrics, and a diagram to illustrate the differences.

## What is pnpm?

pnpm, short for "performant npm," is a drop-in replacement for npm designed to optimize speed, disk efficiency, and dependency handling. Unlike npm’s flat `node_modules` structure and tendency to duplicate dependencies, pnpm uses a content-addressable global store and symlinks to streamline resource usage. Let’s break down the key reasons to make the switch.

## 1. Disk Space Efficiency

pnpm’s standout feature is its approach to dependency storage. Instead of duplicating packages across projects, it maintains a single global store (typically at `~/.pnpm-store`) and links dependencies into project-specific `node_modules` folders.

- **npm**: Installs a full copy of each dependency per project, even if the same version exists elsewhere. This redundancy adds up quickly.
- **pnpm**: Stores each package version once in the global store, using hard links or symlinks to reference it, cutting disk usage significantly.

**Metrics**: A pnpm team study found that a React app with 50+ dependencies consumed ~300 MB with npm but only ~100 MB with pnpm—a 66% reduction. In monorepos with shared dependencies across multiple packages, savings often exceed 80%.

**Technical Detail**: The store uses content-addressable hashes (e.g., `react-18.2.0_abc123`) to identify packages, ensuring no duplication across projects.

## 2. Installation Speed

pnpm outperforms npm in install speed, especially for large projects or monorepos, thanks to its global store and parallelized dependency resolution.

- **npm**: Resolves and downloads dependencies sequentially, even for cached packages, and flattens the dependency tree, slowing down the process.
- **pnpm**: Uses the global store to avoid redundant downloads and resolves dependencies in parallel, leveraging a nested structure with symlinks.

**Metrics**: According to 2023 benchmarks from pnpm’s site, installing 100 packages took:

- npm: ~25 seconds (cold install), ~15 seconds (cached).
- pnpm: ~10 seconds (cold install), ~3 seconds (cached).

For monorepos with 10+ packages, pnpm can be 2-3x faster due to its linking strategy.

**Technical Detail**: pnpm’s resolver processes dependencies concurrently using a topological sort, minimizing fetch times compared to npm’s sequential approach.

## 3. Strict Dependency Management

npm’s flat structure often hoists sub-dependencies to the root `node_modules`, risking accidental reliance on unlisted packages. pnpm enforces stricter isolation.

- **npm**: Hoisting can lead to “phantom dependencies,” where code uses packages not in your `package.json`.
- **pnpm**: Nests dependencies under their parent packages via symlinks, ensuring only declared dependencies are accessible.

**Example**: If `package-a` depends on `sub-dep@1.0.0` and `package-b` uses `sub-dep@2.0.0`, npm might hoist `sub-dep@2.0.0`, causing version conflicts. pnpm keeps `sub-dep@1.0.0` isolated within `package-a`’s scope.

## 4. Monorepo Support

For monorepos (e.g., with Nx or Turborepo), pnpm shines with its workspace feature, managing multiple packages efficiently.

- **npm**: Each package gets its own `node_modules`, duplicating shared dependencies.
- **pnpm**: Symlinks dependencies from the global store and uses `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to define workspace packages, reducing overhead.

**Metrics**: In a monorepo with 5 packages sharing 80% of dependencies, npm used ~1.2 GB, while pnpm used ~400 MB—a 66% reduction.

### Key Differences:

- **Duplication**: npm duplicates packages across projects; pnpm stores each version once globally
- **Dependency Structure**: npm hoists dependencies to the root; pnpm isolates dependencies per package
- **Symlinks**: pnpm uses symlinks to reference the global store; npm has no linking mechanism
- **Disk Usage**: pnpm significantly reduces storage requirements, especially in monorepos

## 5. Additional Features

- **Lockfile Integrity**: `pnpm-lock.yaml` provides explicit dependency resolution, reducing inconsistencies compared to `package-lock.json`.
- **Offline Mode**: The global store enables faster offline installs with cached packages.
- **Security**: Avoiding hoisting minimizes risks from malicious sub-dependencies.

## When to Stick with npm?

npm may still suit:

- Legacy projects with npm-specific scripts.
- Teams unprepared to adopt a new tool.

However, with pnpm’s growing adoption (e.g., default in Qwik and SolidStart), these cases are diminishing.

## Conclusion

Upgrading from npm to pnpm brings substantial improvements: 66% disk space savings, 2-3x faster installs, stricter dependency management, and robust monorepo support. For modern JavaScript development, it’s a clear win. To switch, run `npm install -g pnpm` and `pnpm install` in your project. Your disk and build times will thank you.
