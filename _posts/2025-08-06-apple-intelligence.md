"How Apple Fell Behind in the AI Race". Critics have been quick to point out that Apple Intelligence isn't up to standard. But what exactly is the standard? What should Apple Intelligence actually look like? I actually have no idea.

I actually don't know why I'm writing this post. But after months of working on AI agents, I realized the ones I appreciate the most are usually the simplest ones. I don't really need a flashy "Book me a plane ticket" demo. What I actually want is an agent that gives me all the flight options, lets me choose between a cheaper ticket or a better location, helps me weigh the tradeoffs between price and timing, and remembers if I usually prefer to arrive in the morning or evening. I want something that helps me make the right decision for me, not just makes the decision for me.

While other companies chase bigger and stronger models, Apple has the opportunity to define AI differently. Instead of competing on raw power, Apple could create something that feels more human, more integrated, and more like something that people would actually use on a daily basis.

To understand what Apple Intelligence should be, let's borrow a framework from Airbnb's Brian Chesky. On Reid Hoffman's podcast, Masters of Scale, Chesky talked about designing experiences using an 11-star framework. The idea is to design the extreme experience first, then work backwards to what's actually feasible.

Let's apply this framework to Apple Intelligence.

## The 11-Star Apple Intelligence Framework

Using Brian Chesky's framework, let's design the extreme Apple Intelligence experience and work backwards to what's actually feasible:

### Level 1: "Refund Me" - No Response

You ask Siri a simple question, and it doesn't respond at all. The AI is completely broken or unavailable.

### Level 2: "I Had to Wait" - Slow and Inaccurate

Siri responds, but it takes 10 seconds and gives you the wrong answer. The experience is frustrating and unreliable.

### Level 5: "Expected Experience" - Basic Functionality

You ask Siri to set a timer, and it does exactly that. It works as expected, but nothing more. This is where most assistants currently sit.

### Level 6: "Love it More Than Other AI" - Trusted Delegation

You can hand off tasks to Apple Intelligence and trust it completely. "Handle my calendar for the week" or "Organize my photos from the trip" and you know it will be done right. You don't need to check back.

### Level 7: "Way Beyond" - Complete Autonomy

Apple Intelligence doesn't just do what you ask—it takes initiative. "I noticed your presentation is due tomorrow and you haven't started. I've pulled together your research, created an outline, and scheduled time to work on it. Want me to start the first draft?" It's like having a partner who knows you well enough to act on your behalf.

### Level 10: Complete Life Management

Apple Intelligence runs your entire digital life. You wake up and everything is already handled—meetings scheduled, emails prioritized, tasks organized, and decisions made on your behalf. You trust it completely to manage your life as well as you would yourself.

### Level 11: Beyond Imagination

Apple Intelligence doesn't just manage your life—it transforms it. It sees opportunities you can't see, makes connections you wouldn't make, and creates possibilities that didn't exist before. "I've analyzed your career trajectory and found a perfect opportunity. I've already scheduled the interview and prepared your portfolio. You're going to love this." It's like having a genius partner who knows you better than you know yourself.

## The Lines of Feasibility

The sweet spot for Apple Intelligence lies between Levels 6 and 7—where you can completely trust the AI to handle tasks without checking back, and where it takes initiative on your behalf. This is the difference between "AI as a tool" and "AI as a trusted partner." You hand off a task and forget about it, knowing it will be done right.

### Some cool features I'm looking forward to

- **Smart Alarm Management**: Realizes that I'm on leave tomorrow and asks if I want to turn off my 7am alarm for the day (super simple, but super cool!)
- **Proactive Context Awareness**: A system that works quietly in the background, proactively suggesting things I might need, and seamlessly integrates across all my Apple devices
- **Intelligent Restaurant Recommendations**: Suggests dinner spots for dates/friends by considering location convenience, your food preferences, price range, and reading through reviews to find the perfect match. No more endless Google searches and review reading!

## Some Final Thoughts

The goal isn't to create the most powerful AI, it's to create the most thoughtful AI that enhances the Apple experience while respecting the values that make Apple special.

Apple Intelligence should feel like magic, but magic that you understand and control. It should make your devices feel more personal, not more intrusive. And most importantly, it should make the Apple ecosystem more valuable than the sum of its parts.

I'm excited to see what this future would look like!
